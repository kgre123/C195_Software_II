Title and Purpose
The title of this application is "Appointment Management System" and it was created to allow for a business to create customer records
and appointments. This allows for them to be able to input or retrieve data from their database without having to know the code behind it.
This project was also created for the assignment for C195: Software II-Advanced Java Concepts.

My Information
The author of this project is myself, Kyle Green. My contact information is as follows:
Student ID: #000522803
Email: kgre123@wgu.edu
This is version 1.0 of the application that I have created and it was completed on April 26th, 2022.

My Environment
For this project, I used IntelliJ version 2021.1.3x64. This was the version that came loaded on the virtual machine.
The JDK used was jdk-17.0.1 and the JavaFX version that was used was javafx-jdk-17.0.1

Directions for the Program
To run the program, all of the prerequisite software must be installed on the device. This includes an IDE for Java,
mySQL workbench and all of the necessary components listed above (JDK, SDK, Connector). After that is all installed and
the IDE is pulled up, the person would have to execute the program. The first screen would be a login screen. The username
and password that I used for the program were both "test" without the quotation marks. After logging in, the person would
navigate through the program by clicking the various buttons and entering in the information required. There are a lot of different
ways that you can go through the program, and there are a lot of instructions included in the implementation of the program.

If this were to be used in a business setting, I would have to configure some different things to make this program
execute outside of the IDE, but that was not required for this course.

Additional Report
For my additional report, I created a report that showed appointments based on the customer. This basically created
a customer schedule so that they could see everything that was coming up for them. This would be helpful to the customer
as they could ask someone about their appointments and it would be easy to find.

MySQL Connector
For this project, I did the majority of the work on the virtual environment. Using that environment, I used the
mySQL connector "mysql-connector-java-8.0.22.jar." This is what came preloaded on the virtual machine.
