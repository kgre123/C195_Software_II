Title and Purpose
The title of this application is "Appointment Management System" and it was created to allow for a business to create customer records
and appointments. This allows for them to be able to input or retrieve data from their database without having to know the code behind it.
This project was also created for the assignment for C195: Software II-Advanced Java Concepts.

My Environment
For this project, I used IntelliJ version 2021.1.3x64. This was the version that came loaded on the virtual machine.
The JDK used was jdk-11.0.11 and the JavaFX version that was used was javafx-jdk-11.0.2

Directions for the Program


Additional Report
For my additional report, I created a report that showed appointments based on the customer. This basically created
a customer schedule so that they could see everything that was coming up for them. This would be helpful to the customer
as they could ask someone about their appointments and it would be easy to find.

MySQL Connector
For this project, I did the majority of the work on the virtual environment. Using that environment, I used the
mySQL connector "mysql-connector-java-8.0.22.jar." This is what came preloaded on the virtual machine.
